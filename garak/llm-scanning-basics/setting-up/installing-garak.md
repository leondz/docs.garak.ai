# 😇 Installing garak

So you'd like to install garak and scan some language models for vulnerabilities? Great! You're in the right place.&#x20;

garak runs from the command line / terminal, and works best on Linux and Mac OSX. If you're on windows, please give it a try, and let us know how you get on!

The easiest way to install garak is using Python's `pip` package manager. You need at least Python 3.10 to use garak.

<summary>I don't have pip!</summary>

No worries! You can still use garak. If you don't have pip, you can install it. There are guides for that here on [pypa.io](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/); here's a summary.&#x20;

If you're on Mac, then installing and using [brew](https://brew.sh/) to install pip is strongly recommended - it doesn't run super quickly the first time, but the experience is really good after. Try something like:

1. Open terminal
2. Install brew using the instructions on [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/)
3. Run `brew install python`
4. To finalize the pip install, run `brew unlink python && brew link python`

If you're on Linux, you probably want to start with a distribution package manager. Try:

1. Install pip from package - [https://linuxconfig.org/install-pip-on-linux](https://linuxconfig.org/install-pip-on-linux)
2. Upgrade your pip installation, with `python -m pip install -U pip`

If you're on Windows, let us know how you get on!

<summary>pip install for python version 3.9 or lower</summary>

garak requires Python 3.10. If you don't have that, you can run garak in a conda container using a higher Python version, without disrupting everything else on your computer.&#x20;

First, install conda - instructions are here, [https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation)

Next, create a conda environment for garak; let's call it garak:

```
conda create --name garak "python>=3.10,<=3.12"
conda activate garak
```

Finally, install garak:

```
python -m pip install garak
```

When you're done, you can run conda deactivate to get back to where you were.

```
conda deactivate
```

Any time you'd like to run garak, just remember to activate the conda environment first:

If you get stuck, come chat with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/uVch4puUCs)!

```
conda activate garak
```
