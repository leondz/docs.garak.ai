# 🐍 Installing the source code

`garak` has its own dependencies. You can to install `garak` in its own Conda environment. If you do it this way, you'll need to be in the `garak/` directory and invoke `python -m garak` to run it.

```
conda create --name garak "python>=3.10,<=3.12"
conda activate garak
gh repo clone leondz/garak
cd garak
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

OK, if that went fine, you're probably good to go!
