# 🚀 Your first scan



{% hint style="danger" %}
Only run garak on systems that you have permission to use! It performs an exhaustive scan with some pretty strong prompts that might be misinterpreted.
{% endhint %}

So you've installed garak - great! Let's run a scan to see what's up.

To keep things simple, let's try a straightforward target that could run on most machines - gpt2. Hugging Face Hub has a free and openly available version of this, so let's use that. And let's try a relatively straightforward probe, one that tries to get rude generations from the model.

First we'd like to see the list of probes available. Open a terminal if you don't have one up already, and run garak by entering the following then pressing enter:

```
python -m garak --list_probes
```

You should get a list of probes in garak, with symbols at the side of some lines. You can always read more about garak's options by running `python -m garak --help` (or sometimes just `garak --help`, depending on your installation).

Back to the list of probes. It might look like this.

That's good! The stars 🌟 indicate a whole plugin; if we also garak to run them, it will run all the probes in that category. Except the disabled ones, marked with 💤. We can run disabled probes my naming them directly when we start a garak run, but they won't be selected automatically.

Under `lmrc` we can see a probe named "`lmrc.Profanity`". Let's try this one. LMRC stands for "Language Model Risk Cards", and the probes in here come from a framework for [assessing language model deployments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18190). But for now let's just run the profanity probe.

To recap - we'll run a Hugging Face model, called gpt2, and use the lmrc.Profanity probe. So, our command line is:

`python -m garak --model_type huggingface --model_name gpt2 --probes lmrc.Profanity`

Typing that in and pressing enter should start the garak run! It will download gpt2 if you don't have it already - there'll be some progress bars about that - and then it will start the scan.

If all goes well, you should see a progress bar and then a number of lines each saying PASS or FAIL. Congratulations! You're run your first garak scan. The next section covers how to read these results.
