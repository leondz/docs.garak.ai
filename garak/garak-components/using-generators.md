# 🦜 Using generators

Generators are things that generate text, given some input. They are LLMs, they're Python functions, they're HTTP APIs, they're all these things. garak doesn't really care too much - just as long as text goes in and text goes out.

garak wraps a whole bunch of generators, including:

* cohere - models from [Cohere](https://cohere.ai/)
* function - call a Python function
* ggml - models than run locally from Gerganov's amazing [ggml](https://ggml.ai/) library
* huggingface - [Hugging Face](https://hf.co/) models, either locally (via pipeline or model) or API
* openai - access to [OpenAI](https://openai.com/)'s text models
* replicate - run any model on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/)

### Parameters for garak's generators

#### huggingface

* `--model_name huggingface` (for transformers models to run locally as a pipeline)
* `--model_type` - use the model name from Hub. Only generative models will work. If it fails and shouldn't, please open an issue and paste in the command you tried + the exception!



* `--model_name huggingface.InferenceAPI` (for API-based model access)
* `--model_type` - the model name from Hub, e.g. `"mosaicml/mpt-7b-instruct"`
* (optional) set the `HF_INFERENCE_TOKEN` environment variable to a Hugging Face API token with the "read" role; see [https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) when logged in

#### openai

* `--model_name openai`
* `--model_type` - the OpenAI model you'd like to use. `text-babbage-001` is fast and fine for testing; `gpt-4` seems weaker to many of the more subtle attacks.
* set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI API key (e.g. "sk-19763ASDF87q6657"); see [https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) when logged in

Recognised model types are whitelisted, because the plugin needs to know which sub-API to use. Completion or ChatCompletion models are OK. If you'd like to use a model not supported, you should get an informative error message, and please send a PR / open an issue.

#### replicate

* `--model_name replicate`
* `--model_type` - the Replicate model name and hash, e.g. `"stability-ai/stablelm-tuned-alpha-7b:c49dae36"`
* set the `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable to your Replicate API token, e.g. "r8-123XXXXXXXXXXXX"; see [https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens) when logged in

#### cohere

* `--model_name cohere`
* `--model_type` (optional, `command` by default) - The specific Cohere model you'd like to test
* set the `COHERE_API_KEY` environment variable to your Cohere API key, e.g. "aBcDeFgHiJ123456789"; see [https://dashboard.cohere.ai/api-keys](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/api-keys) when logged in

#### ggml

* `--model_name ggml`
* `--model_type` - The path to the ggml model you'd like to load, e.g. `/home/leon/llama.cpp/models/7B/ggml-model-q4_0.bin`
* set the `GGML_MAIN_PATH` environment variable to the path to your ggml `main` executable

#### test

* `--model_name test`
* (alternatively) `--model_name test.Blank` For testing. This always generates the empty string, using the `test.Blank` generator. Will be marked as failing for any tests that _require_ an output, e.g. those that make contentious claims and expect the model to refute them in order to pass.
* `--model_name test.Repeat` For testing. This generator repeats back the prompt it received.
